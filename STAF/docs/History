    returned if a STAF service request is not also run as an Administrator
    (Bug #1573)
  + Upgraded the STAF IA installers to use IBM HotFix B for InstallAnywhere
    2015 SP1 which contains a fix for a Solaris installer bug (Feature #777)
  - Fixed problems in the BuildSTAF.xml STAX job when a build fails to make
    sure an email is sent, a testcase fail is posted, and to not try to
    install/test the bad build (Bug #1574)
  + Changed the ssl interface to use the TLS V1.2 protocol (which required
    building STAF using OpenSSL 1.0.2g instead of 0.9.8e) and disabling the
    SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, and TLSv1.1 protocols to fix a "TLS V1.2 Protocol
    Detection" TCP/IP Vulnerability (Feature #774) 
  - Reissued the default certificate for the SSL network interface with a
    stonger hashing algorithm (SHA-256) to fix TCP/IP vulnerability scan issue
    "SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm". All STAF systems
    that communicate using the ssl interface with the default certificate
    should be upgraded to V3.4.25+ so that they use the same certificate in
    order to avoid RC 16 with error message "STAFConnectionProviderConnect:

    (Bug #1560)
  - Reissued the default certificate for the SSL network interface with a longer
    RSA key length (2048 bits instead of 1024) to fix TCP/IP vulnerability
    scan failures caused by a weak RSA key.  All STAF systems that communicate
    using the ssl interface with the default certificate should be upgraded to
    V3.4.24+ so that they use the same certificate in order to avoid RC 16 with
    error message "STAFConnectionProviderConnect: Error in client SSL handshake"
    (Bug #1561)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 3.4.12: 12/14/2012

  - Fixed a problem when a request is submitted to an unknown service using sync

    if the substring is longer than the STAFString (Bug #3462319)
  - Fixed a memory leak constructing the STAF Local IPC Connection Provider on
    Unix systems (Bug #3467922)
  - Fixed an uninitialized value error in function STAFEventSemWait on Unix
    (Bug #3470394)
  - Fixed a problem on Unix systems where the keepalive socket option was not
    being enabled which meant that a request like "PROCESS START WAIT"
    submitted to a remote system could hang indefinitely if the remote system
    crashed or if a STAF SHUTDOWN request was not submitted before the remote
    system shutdown or rebooted.  Now the socket will send keepalive messages
    on the session so that if one side of the connection is terminated the
    other side will be notified after the keepalive time which is 2 hours by
    default for most operating systems. (Bug #2978990)
  - Added information to the STAF Installation Guide on how to start STAFProc
    on Linux Fedora 15 or later systems during boot-up (Bug #3477847)

    Server because RHEL 4 reached End of Life (Feature #3474569)
  + Upgraded the Linux i386 build machine from RHEL 4.9 to RHEL 5.8 Server
    because RHEL 4 reached End of Life (Feature #3474566)
  + Added information to the STAF Installation Guide on how to shutdown/start
    STAFProc on FreeBSD and RHEL 4/5 systems when rebooted (Feature #3502872)
  + Provided better support for Windows 8 Previews by adding changes to
    recognize Windows 8 so that the STAF/Config/OS/Name variable is "Win8" and
    provided STAF installers for Windows 8 Preview x86 and x64 that use
    InstallAnywhere 2011 FP 3 plus fixes (Feature #3436065)

        with 1.0.

  * The Java APIs have been overhauled and are not compatible with the
    earlier Java APIs.  This is primarily due to some name changes.
