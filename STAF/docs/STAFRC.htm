<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRRETCODE">API Return Codes</A></H1>
<P><B>Note: </B>In some shell environments, return codes above 255 may be returned modulo
256.  This can, in particular, cause service return codes (which range from
4000 upward) to be mistaken for (possibly) non-existent common STAF return
codes.  For example, if a service returned the return code 4010, this might
appear to be the return code 170 (4010 modulo 256) in a shell
environment.

<LI>If the STAF_INSTANCE_NAME environment variable is not set, it defaults

<LI>This error can also occur when submitting a request using the local IPC
interface on a Unix machine if the socket file that the local interface uses
has been inadvertently deleted. 
<LI>On Windows, with User Account Controls (UAC) enabled, if STAFProc.exe
is being run as an Administrator, this error will occur if a STAF service
request is not also run as an Administrator (e.g. from an "Administrator:
Command Prompt") or if programs that submit STAF service requests using
STAF APIs for Java, C/C++, Perl, Python, or Tcl are not run an an
Administrator. See section "5.1.2 Running STAFProc on Windows with User
Account Controls (UAC) Enabled" in the STAF User's Guide for more information.

in the middle of a remote service request.  This can also indicate that the
requested endpoint is not valid (e.g. it has an invalid network interface and
port combination such as a non-secure tcp interface with the port for a secure
ssl interface).
